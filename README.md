# The Redruth and District Chamber of Commerce Website

Anyone can contribute changes to this site by opening a pull request.  If we don't approve your pull request strait away we'll discuss it at the next chamber meeting and perhaps put it to a vote, though we expect the vast majority to be swiftly approved.  

If you don't know how to open a pull request or edit HTML no problem, changes can be emailed to any of the Chamber Officers, who will be more than happy to open a pull request on your behalf.

This is only the first stage of the build of the new Chamber website and we hope to implement a Content Management system and other special members only content in the near future.  Please bear with us and feel free to make a contribution however you can.  

## Roadmap
- [ ] We're going to make a quick video to show how you can contribute changes to the webste and how to sign up for a github account.
- [ ] Please contribute details about your business so we can add you to the list of members and help drive traffic to your website.
